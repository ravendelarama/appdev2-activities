What strategies can you implement to ensure timely updates and maintenance of your software to adapt to changes in third-party software requirements?

A very common strategy for ensuring the proper maintenance of your software for easily adapting to changes in third-party requirements is staying informed, being aware of new updates and changes announced by the service providers by following their blogs; developer communities and newsletters. Another strategy is Diversing, which means to diverse your reliance on multiple third-party providers instead of solely relying on one. Diversification reduces dependency and allows easier access to alternative solutions.
